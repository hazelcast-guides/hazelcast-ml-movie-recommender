Create a pipeline to run a Python movie recommendation function 
and apply it to a .txt file containing movie name(s). 
Output will be a file containing several recommendations
based off of similar cast members and common genres.

Please edit data/input/input.txt with the text of your movie.
(Foreign movies - use the original name, if the language uses logograms,
use romanized title.)
